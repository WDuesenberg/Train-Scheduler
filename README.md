# Train-Scheduler
The code in this html and JavaScript document is a good reference for properly using moment.js for timing events.
Also it is a good reference for using firebase or any type of non server based database.
The document itself allows users to ceate their own train, its destintion and its schedule(moment.js) while the database(firebase) keeps track of all prevously posted user train info.
